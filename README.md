# One-Click-Connect
RaspberryPi to ESP8266 communication through RF

ESP initiates the communication after a button click, to which the PI answers with a WIFI SSID and password, which the ESP will use to connect to the selected network

This sub-project was created for the LAZZYROOM Delta project done during my Bachelors degree at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.
